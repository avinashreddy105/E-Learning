                    <p>n 1994, Hakon Wium Lie, a Norwegian web pioneer, and Bert Bos, a Dutch programmer, proposed the first CSS specification. Their vision was to separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), thus simplifying web development and making it more flexible.
                        CSS: It enhances the appearance of the web page by applying styles to the HTML elements. CSS controls visual properties such as colors, fonts, margins, padding, borders, backgrounds, and positioning.
                        The three types of CSS are external, internal, and inline. External CSS is a file that HTML files will link to. Internal CSS is specified at the beginning of an HTML document. Inline CSS is written for a specific element in the HTML document.
